Abstract: 

Background: The major landmark for puberty in females is menarche. There seem to be change in the age of menarche over the years which may have resulted from some factors like environment, socio and economic status of subject.

Aim: This cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the average age of menarche in the study population and ascertain whether the place of residence and socioeconomic status play any role.

Method: The study population was 510 female students, 243 of which had attained menarche. 130 of them were in the urban areas and 113 in rural areas. The study was carried out among students of Junior Secondary schools one to three that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria in six selected schools where eighty five students from each of the schools were randomly selected.

Results: Findings show that the most frequent age of menarche in urban areas was 12years and that of rural was 13years. The average age of menarche from this study was (12.68 ± 1.365years) while that from urban and rural areas were (12.18 ± 1.287years) and (13.26 ± 1.223years) respectively. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the age of menarche in rural and urban areas. Similarly significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed between age of menarche across the five socioeconomic classes in the rural and urban areas.

Conclusion: The mean age of menarche was earlier among residents of urban areas. The effect of place of residence and socio-economic status affected the mean age of menarche.
