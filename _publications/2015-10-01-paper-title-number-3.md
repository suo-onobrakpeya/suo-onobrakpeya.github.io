Abstract

Objectives: This research aimed to understand the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine  hesitancy  in  Nigeria,  as  well  as  understand  the  decision-making  process behind the choice to vaccinate or not.

Methods:  This  research  employed  a  qualitative  research  methodology, utilizing  semi-structured  interviews.  Eighteen  participants  were  selected  using  a purposive sampling procedure. 

Results:  The  determinants  of  COVID-19  vaccine  hesitancy  identified  in Nigeria  were  Doubt-based  determinants:  (1)  Doubt  in  the  vaccine,  manufacturers and  available  vaccine  knowledge,  (2)  Distrust  and  dissatisfaction  in  the government, and (3) Doubt in COVID-19â€™s   existence, (4) Perceptions and beliefs-based determinants and (5) Situational determinants.
For the decision-making process, three pathways were identified: The Hesitant -  Vaccinated  Pathway,  The  Hesitant  -  Unvaccinated  Pathway  and  The  Willing  - Hesitant - Unvaccinated Pathway.  

Conclusions:  Doubt  was  found  to  be  a  prominent  determinant.  Determinants were not limited to socioeconomic status, or education level.
