About Me
======
I am a public health researcher and health educator. My research thus far has focused on health promotion and behaviors around COVID-19 vaccination, barriers to physical activity among African women and menarche in girls. Summarily, my research has encompassed women's health, health behavior and promotion. I am interested in promoting and improving health of women and vulnerable populations through impactful and research-informed interventions.
